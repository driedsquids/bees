# its bees


#### asdfghjk

##### so like to make this work
###### you just
- grab the files
- and then u compile them  
    `make all`  

- and then u like  
    `sudo insmod bees.ko`  

- check `dmesg`  

- find where it says `bees loaded; [some number]`  
- take the number  

`cd /dev`  
`/dev $ sudo mknod bees c [the number] 0`  

and then u just  
have bees  
you can `cat` them  
and thats like it actually it just spams "z"
